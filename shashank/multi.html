        The Journal Square celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi in Jersey City were really quite amazing. People dressed in traditional Indian garb filled the streets, bringing a kaleidoscope of ethnic expression to life. The streets were lively and colorful. Of the many people contributing to the festival's uniqueness, a young man was deftly creating elaborate rangolis—art created on the floor with colorful powdered limestone—at the entrance to the main celebration area, attracting a small crowd appreciating his art.

        The diversity of attendees was what really caught the viewer's interest. Although the majority of the attendees were Indians, it was stimulating to see people from other cultures and nations participating in the celebrations. Well, in addition to the culture of the festival, everyone was also dressed to impress. There was an air of excitement about possibly meeting someone special, and the mood was exhilarating. The event itself heightens the amorous atmosphere, providing the ideal setting for building relationships.

        The smells of Indian food drew visitors to food stalls full of classic goodies like modaks and chaat. A couple from Italy was talking about how excited they were to be experiencing these meals for the first time, and their smiles were getting brighter with every bite. It was clear that the festival provided a forum for gastronomic discovery, enabling guests to partake in discussions about culture and tradition in addition to savoring Indian cuisine.

        <h5>A little context about the festival</h5>
        <p>
          Ganesh Chaturthi is an occasion for celebrating and worshipping Lord Ganesh, the remover of obstacles, and marking his birthdate. Many people believe that Lord Ganesh establishes order in the cosmos and worship him before starting a new project, undertaking, or commercial venture.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the last day of the festival, Uttarpuja is performed, a ritual bidding Ganesha farewell. After, he is carried in a public procession with kirtan (devotional music) to a nearby body of water in which he is immersed. This custom is Ganpati Visarjan, and it symbolizes his return to Mount Kailash, a peak in the Himalayas where Lord Ganesh's parents, Shiva and Parvati, are said to reside.
