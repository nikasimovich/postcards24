      On the first weekend of September, New York’s Art on Paper, an annual fair centered around modern and contemporary paper-focused art, returned to Pier 36. The space was bustling and invigorating. Arranged by rows with vestibules and vendors throughout, there were thought-provoking works from over 100 international artists around every corner.

      The cohesive throughline of the event was, as the name suggested, art on literal paper. But the mediums showcased were diverse. These ranged from gemstone-laden prints of the Simpsons to Warhol’s diamond-dusted Superman on display. Charcoal, acrylic, watercolor, pencil and collage were utilized, with the majority of the works involving mixed media.
    <p>
      While most attendees were just observing or photographing the art, there were exchanges made. Art was being purchased, contact information was exchanged, and in one observed instance, an art buyer consulted between her client on facetime and an artist.

  Once I located the space, navigating along South Street in the rain, I embraced an art-filled afternoon. At either end of the large space, there were free beverages, including wine and cocktails, as well as a sushi counter. From a facilitating standpoint, they were prepared for the needs of artists and catering to an audience that might want to settle in for a while. From the size of the crowd, it appeared to be working, and the event intends to open for a 2025 season.
