      Open mic nights are important events for any hobbyist or career driven musician, but can occasionally be hard to find in a new city. But, a sharp eye can find them in any historic but stylish neighborhood such as Williamsburg. And in a perfectly divish bar like Pete’s Candy Store.

     There are characters that seem to come from all walks of  life to either perform their own art or simply sit and listen.

        This particular open mic night had a completely full lineup with musicians representing a variety of ages, as well as several countries. Most were only armed with guitars and their voices, but there was the occasional bass guitar or added pedals that came with singers that were brave enough to bend the rules for their art. 
      </p>

      <p>
        While not every musician was up to par with some of the venue’s more notable alums, it was truly honorable to witness the respect and reverence this community had for the art coming from the 20 brave souls that surrendered themselves to the three foot by five foot stage. No one talked during any performances, and cheers were given the entire time. 

      </p>

      <p>

        It made me want to pursue the appreciation of art, in all forms.
