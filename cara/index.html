      <h5>Zooming In</h5>
      <p>
    Even at first glance, the pieces displayed at Art on Paper were undeniably beautiful. But as I stepped closer, I found myself increasingly amazed by the level of intricate detail in each work. Paper, as a medium, is inherently fragile, and this delicacy only heightened the beauty of the craftsmanship. From a distance, a piece often appears complete, cohesive—a finished whole. However, zoom in and <span class="italic">the art bares its humanity</span> - brush strokes, paint chips, and fine lines - exposing the work dedicated to it by the artist. In the end, it is the symphony of small details that creates a beautiful whole.
