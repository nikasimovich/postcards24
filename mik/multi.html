      <p>It is a protest held on this day, specifically, to portray a broader message, a deeper message. Labor Day. A day meant to honor and recognize the American labor movement. Yet, I had to take the L train and then the F downtown to Judson Memorial Church at 5:30 pm because my job let me off at 5. Special hours. It’s a holiday. Labor Day. But I still have to work because labor means different things to different people. Freedom means different things, too. And so does genocide.</p></div>

      <p><span class="italic">In line.</span>  When I first get there, the line to Judson Memorial Church goes around the block, curving onto Washington Square Street, Sullivan Street, and W Third Street like a <span class="italic">C.</span>   Purple NYU shirts are draped with keffiyehs because, while it might be back to school week in NYC, we know that is not the case in Palestine. </p>
      <p>My first impression: warmth. I’m waiting in line on the sidewalk to attend this event alone, but I’m welcomed. A girl asks to use my hotspot. I overhear conversations of people catching up, people meeting each other for the first time, people actively deciding to spend their day off here. I’m shy. I write them down. I replay the words exchanged like friendship even among strangers. I know I will remember this. Here. Ahead of me, multiple people wave multiple Palestinian flags. The wind ruffles through them like it, too, knows why we’re here. </p> </div>

They keep announcing that the line goes out the door. I know. I was just in it.  Ran out of cash buying a watermelon keychain. Got chicken shawarma. It is bigger than my forearm. They accepted Apple Pay. I love living in the future. The man who hands me the food makes eye contact with me before doing so. I bow my head and we exchange our <span class="italic">thank you’s.</span></p></div>
