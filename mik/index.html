        <h5> September 2, 2024</h5>
      <p>It is a protest held on this day, specifically, to portray a broader message, a deeper message. Labor Day. A day meant to honor and recognize the American labor movement. Yet, I had to take the L train and then the F downtown to Judson Memorial Church at 5:30 pm because my job let me off at 5. Special hours. It’s a holiday. Labor Day. But I still have to work because labor means different things to different people. Freedom means different things, too. And so does genocide.</p>
        <h5>5:49 pm</h5>
      <p><span class="italic">In line.</span>  When I first get there, the line to Judson Memorial Church goes around the block, curving onto Washington Square Street, Sullivan Street, and W Third Street like a <span class="italic">C.</span>   Purple NYU shirts are draped with keffiyehs because, while it might be back to school week in NYC, we know that is not the case for Palestine. My first impression: warmth. I’m waiting in line on the sidewalk to attend this event alone, but I’m welcomed. A girl asks to use my hotspot. I overhear conversations of people catching up, people meeting each other for the first time, people actively deciding to spend their day off here. I’m shy. I write them down. I replay the words exchanged like friendship even among strangers. I know I will remember this. Here. Ahead of me, multiple people wave multiple Palestinian flags. The wind ruffles through them like it, too, knows why we’re here. </p>
<h5>6:30 pm</h5>
      <p><span class="italic">First handout.</span> A woman hands out an article criticizing Kamala. Everyone in line takes one. Folding it, stuffing it in their pocket, reading it in the meantime.</p>
<h5>6:36 pm</h5>
     <p><span class="italic">Inside.</span> Vendors slide their business cards into my hands. A man projected on the wall from Zoom discusses the state of emergency aid in Gaza. They keep announcing that the line goes out the door. I know. I was just in it.  Ran out of cash buying a watermelon keychain. Got chicken shawarma. It is bigger than my forearm. They accepted Apple Pay. I love living in the future. The man who hands me the food makes eye contact with me before doing so, as I bow my head and we both say our <span class="italic">thank you’s.</span></p>
  <h5>7:04 pm</h5>
      <p><span class="italic">At Washington Square Park.</span> Delicious! Just delicious. Watching kids skate at the park. I did not enter the raffle, so I’m going to finish eating and then head home.</p>
  <h5>7:20 pm pm</h5>
  <p><span class="italic">Left park.</span> Played a music game on my phone. Felt calm, cozy, comfortable. Like a big hang out and everyone’s invited.</p>

        The powerful effect of the Palestinian liberation movements I've attended, I always leave with more than what I carried in.
