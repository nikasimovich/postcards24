      It was 12 p.m. on Monday, September 2, Labor Day. It was supposed to be a quiet, peaceful holiday in NYC, but pro-Palestinian protesters eventually had other plans – to

      It began at Union Square Park, with an estimated 500 people present at the scene for the rally organized by  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Within_Our_Lifetime">Within Our Lifetime (WOL)</a>
and Healthcare workers for Palestine, a mosaic of activists from organizations like Revolutionary Internationalist Youth, Class Struggle Education Workers, Neturei Karta International, and Mamas 4 A Free Palestine, Workers World Party including students from the Fashion Institute of Technology and the City University of New York, alongside, all chanting in support of the Palestinians. People from all walks of life, men and women, young and old, workers and scholars, were there for a shared cause, inscribing a tale of fervor and solidarity to end the genocide in Gaza.

        <a href="https://x.com/nerdeenkiswani?s=21">Nerdeen Kiswani</a>, Chair of Within Our Lifetime (WOL), stood at the makeshift podium, her voice raw and unamplified howling at the top of her lungs defying NYPD regulations that demanded protests be conducted without microphones, "We are here today to send the alarm on the genocide, on the mass rape, on the purposeful destruction of the healthcare system in Gaza. We are not able to use microphones today which is why you are repeating after me because the repressive NYPD who work directly with the Israeli state have attacked and arrested and repressed us for using our microphone and alleviating the truth." Her words, echoed by the crowd, reverberated through the park, serving a testament to their collective determination.

      In that moment, Union Square Park ceased to be merely a patch of green in the urban sprawl—it transformed into a crucible of hope, where the aspirations of a marginalized people found a voice through the unity of the gathered multitude. As the day unfolded, the echoes of their resolve reverberated through the city, a testament to the enduring spirit of those who dared to stand for Gaza, even amidst the brutal oppression of the NYPD.

      What was supposed to be a peaceful protest—or so I thought—suddenly turned into a massive crowd, which at one point reached <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/us-news/hundreds-of-rabid-anti-israel-protesters-storm-nyc-on-labor-day-light-flares-and-set-off-smoke-bombs/">7000 </a>unruly protesters marching towards the United Nations passing through the Meta Headquarters, Grand Central, CUNY and TNS calling for divestment in Israel. When the NYPD blocked them at 44th Street as protesters potentially marched towards the Isareli consulate, flares lit up the sky, smoke bombs painted it in red and green. With faces concealed in keffiyehs, protesters stood fearlessly neck-to-neck with the NYPD, wielding Palestinian flags, drums beating in rhythm, and voices chanting, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”

      As the march reached the New York Public Library, a confrontation between a protester and a police officer unfolded right before me. The police officer forcefully pushed the protester to the ground with their hands restrained behind their back.

      With the NYPD leading the way alongside other uniformed officers, journalists and press personnel trailed behind them, capturing the unfolding events. At the forefront marched the protest leaders, followed by a sea of thousands of people united in their cause. Witnessing the unity and resilience of the protesters filled me with a sense of empowerment, knowing that I was part of a collective voice standing up for a just cause. The overwhelming feeling of solidarity among the diverse groups present at the protest evoked a deep sense of connection and shared purpose, highlighting the strength in unity.
