      It was 12 p.m. on Monday, September 2, Labor Day. It was supposed to be a quiet, peaceful holiday in NYC, but pro-Palestinian protesters eventually had other plans – to
<a href="https://x.com/wolpalestine/status/1828618034086318519?s=46">“Flood NYC for Gaza.”</a>
      </p>
      <p>
      It began at Union Square Park, with an estimated 500 people present at the scene for the rally organized by  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Within_Our_Lifetime">Within Our Lifetime (WOL)</a>
and Healthcare workers for Palestine, a mosaic of activists from organizations like Revolutionary Internationalist Youth, Class Struggle Education Workers, Neturei Karta International, and Mamas 4 A Free Palestine, Workers World Party including students from the Fashion Institute of Technology and the City University of New York, alongside, all chanting in support of the Palestinians. People from all walks of life, men and women, young and old, workers and scholars, were there for a shared cause, inscribing a tale of fervor and solidarity to end the genocide in Gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
      <a href="https://x.com/nerdeenkiswani?s=21">Nerdeen Kiswani</a>, Chair of Within Our Lifetime (WOL), stood at the makeshift podium, her voice raw and unamplified howling at the top of her lungs defying NYPD regulations that demanded protests be conducted without microphones, "We are here today to send the alarm on the genocide, on the mass rape, on the purposeful destruction of the healthcare system in Gaza. We are not able to use microphones today which is why you are repeating after me because the repressive NYPD who work directly with the Israeli state have attacked and arrested and repressed us for using our microphone and alleviating the truth." Her words, echoed by the crowd, reverberated through the park, serving a testament to their collective determination.
 </p>
      <p>
      “All aid to Israel, including weapons and money, must be stopped," Kiswani said in her speech, with the crowd repeating it back in response. " The Zionist state must be isolated. All Zionist institutions must be dismantled. And all of Palestine must be freed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In that moment, Union Square Park ceased to be merely a patch of green in the urban sprawl—it transformed into a crucible of hope, where the aspirations of a marginalized people found a voice through the unity of the gathered multitude. As the day unfolded, the echoes of their resolve reverberated through the city, a testament to the enduring spirit of those who dared to stand for Gaza, even amidst the brutal oppression of the NYPD.
   </p>
        <p>
        What was supposed to be a peaceful protest—or so I thought—suddenly turned into a massive crowd, which at one point reached <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/us-news/hundreds-of-rabid-anti-israel-protesters-storm-nyc-on-labor-day-light-flares-and-set-off-smoke-bombs/">7000 </a>unruly protesters marching towards the United Nations passing through the Meta Headquarters, Grand Central, CUNY and TNS calling for divestment in Israel. When the NYPD blocked them at 44th Street as protesters potentially marched towards the Isareli consulate, flares lit up the sky, smoke bombs painted it in red and green. With faces concealed in keffiyehs, protesters stood fearlessly neck-to-neck with the NYPD, wielding Palestinian flags, drums beating in rhythm, and voices chanting, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”
        </p>
        <p>
        It was a sight to behold. Witnessing clashes between protesters and law enforcement was a common sight in protest images I had seen, but experiencing it firsthand was a new and jarring experience for me. As the march reached the New York Public Library, a confrontation between a protester and a police officer unfolded right before me. The police officer forcefully pushed the protester to the ground with their hands restrained behind their back. At that moment, I couldn't help but questioned myself how can these people be so committed to this cause. I was overwhelmed by the determination of the girl whose face, covered in keffiyah, black kajal on her eyes, was banging the big drum which was twice her size. Another man, waving the Palestinian flag, chanting, “Intifada! Intifada! Long live the intifada!”

          Seeing the NYPD and its divisions like Legal Matters, Community Affairs, Technical Assistance Response, and the Strategic Response Group was a formidable feeling. It only made me anticipate the potential intensity of the situation, knowing that such a robust law enforcement presence was in place to manage any potential escalation or confrontations with the protesters.

          With the NYPD leading the way alongside other uniformed officers, journalists and press personnel trailed behind them, capturing the unfolding events. At the forefront marched the protest leaders, followed by a sea of thousands of people united in their cause. Witnessing the unity and resilience of the protesters filled me with a sense of empowerment, knowing that I was part of a collective voice standing up for a just cause. The overwhelming feeling of solidarity among the diverse groups present at the protest evoked a deep sense of connection and shared purpose, highlighting the strength in unity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a stirring experience for me, stepping into such a charged atmosphere for the first time, feeling a sense of empowerment akin to that of a seasoned journalist. Alongside my colleague from the New School Free Press and others, we marched from noon until 5 pm, traversing from Union Square to Washington Square Park on that radiant sunny day.
