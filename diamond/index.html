        On September 4, 2024, I was an audience member for Flowers Now (Vol. 2), hosted by <a href="https://getbetterrecords.com/collections/michael-love-michael?srsltid=AfmBOoqrAMXooJ4fco10u--RNEXGW8G7DOlFAf-KfhmeuUwK-m1Qie_5">Michael Love Michael</a></span>, who is currently an MFA student in creative writing at the Schools of Public Engagement at The New School. I found out about the event via her Instagram (michaelxomichael), she uploaded an adorable flier with a pink and turquoise gradient, the title of the event written in a floral hedge font with all of the performers, donation organizations, and the date listed. It was a music event celebrating Black and Brown queer and trans musicians at C’Mon Everybody, a gay bar in Bed-Stuy. The event was supported by The Okra Project, whom gave the entire audience beautiful red gift bags filled with various items, from Listerine mouthwash to free samples of lubricant to Neutrogena Makeup wipes. The Okra Project gave to us, so we gave back to them—and the UNRWA—as the event doubled as a fundraiser for both organizations.

        When Michael Love Michael first walked on stage in her beautiful all black ensemble, she stated her mission with Flowers Now was to “help trans people have a better life and more wholeness”. All of the night that I saw—as I stepped out early due to being overwhelmed from dancing under so many color-changing lights—reflected her desires and energy deeply. I felt peaceful and energized, a combination all too rare for me nowadays.

          The music ranged from acoustic and folky to upbeat pop and sultry R&B. My favorite artist by far the entire night was <a href="https://www.lassaimusic.com/about-2">Lassai</a></span>, who I would describe as an alternative pop-star. Lassai had high energy their entire set, but the song by them that stuck out to me the most was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhFGYDtNGAE">"Purr"</a></span> featuring Grizzy Mack. The whole song feels like a light pink silk sheet when I first heard it; it was bold in terms of lyrics, confident and smooth in vocals with flirty, high energy production. “Purrr” fills a musical craving I did not know I had, it was a fun song and I feel as though experiencing it live when I first heard it added another layer of novelty to it. Lassai’s chorus still rings in my head (multiple times a day) to this day:

        The lyrics are intense while still remaining lightly veiled. I think that’s why they resonate with me so much, it’s pop music that’s actually trying to stimulate the senses, to shake up the scene. I guess that’s what makes it alternative pop. Lassai was performing harder than many popular acts we see nowadays, so I was shocked to find out there were only a couple hundred or so views on the equal parts beautiful, fun, and funny “Purrr” music video (for now). People always say, <span class="italic">we</span> (Black people) have to work twice as hard for half of what <span class="italic">they</span> (white people) have; but I think <span class="italic">we</span> have to work eight times as hard for a quarter of what <span class="italic">they</span> have. It’s more grueling than doubling it. Sometimes when I get job or fellowship rejections, or ghostings, I feel like they’re asking me to surpass, to graze at their culture until all that’s left are the bones of a poor joke. How much bigger can bigger be?

      Anyway, I’m a Lassai fan now. I love the passion and effort they put in to their music and performances. When I watched them perform, I could tell they knew their shit; I left feeling elated and inspired by everyone, but Lassai radiated a popstar excellence I still can’t shake. Is this what it felt like to watch Lady Gaga perform before she was famous? I think so. I feel like I had an experience that people will soon be jealous of.

    Overall, the night was great. Everyone did amazing and took up the whole stage, and I am extremely happy they did. I felt safe and excited the entire time which is rare at events in New York.
 I need to get out more so I can go to more events like this. And host events like this.
